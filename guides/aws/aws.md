# Example Setup with AWS

**WARNING:** The resources created in this guide will cost about \$70.00/month. The actual price might depend on its usage, but make sure to delete the resources as described in Step 5 Deinstallation when you do not need them anymore.

**NOTE:** If you find anything in this guide which is out of date (e.g. needs a version number increased) or doesn't work anymore, please help us by telling us in this ticket [#15](https://github.com/juice-shop/multi-juicer/issues/15) or by opening a pull request with a fix ðŸ™Œ

## Prerequisites

This example expects you to have the following cli tools setup.

1. [awscli](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/)
2. [eksctl](https://eksctl.io/installation/)
3. [helm](https://helm.sh)
4. [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/#install-kubectl-on-macos)

```sh
# First we'll need a cluster, you can create one using the eksctl cli.
# This will take a couple of minutes
eksctl create cluster \
--name multi-juicer \
--nodegroup-name standard-workers \
--node-type t3.medium \
--nodes 2 \
--nodes-min 1 \
--nodes-max 4

# After completion verify that your kubectl context has been updated:
# Should print something like: Administrator@multi-juicer.eu-central-1.eksctl.io
kubectl config current-context
```

## Step 2. Installing MultiJuicer via helm

```sh
helm install multi-juicer oci://ghcr.io/juice-shop/multi-juicer/helm/multi-juicer

# kubernetes will now spin up the pods
# to verify every thing is starting up, run:
kubectl get pods
# This should show you two pods a juice-balancer pod and a progress-watchdog pod
# Wait until both pods are ready
```

## Step 3. Verify the app is running correctly

This step is optional, but helpful to catch errors quicker.

```sh
# lets test out if the app is working correctly before proceeding
# for that we can port forward the JuiceBalancer service to your local machine
kubectl port-forward service/juice-balancer 3000:3000

# Open up your browser for localhost:3000
# You should be able to see the MultiJuicer Balancer UI

# Try to create a team and see if everything works correctly
# You should be able to access a JuiceShop instances after a few seconds after creating a team,
# and after clicking the "Start Hacking" Button

# You can also try out if the admin UI works correctly
# Go back to localhost:3000/balancer
# To log in as the admin log in as the team "admin"
# The password for the team gets autogenerated if not specified, you can extract it from the kubernetes secret:
kubectl get secrets juice-balancer-secret -o=jsonpath='{.data.adminPassword}' | base64 --decode
```

## Step 4. Add Ingress to expose the app to the world

Create a loadbalancer which is exposed is achieved by running the following command:

```sh
kubectl create -f  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/juice-shop/multi-juicer/main/guides/aws/loadbalancer.yaml
```

You can get the LoadBalancer's DNS record either from the AWS console, or by running:

```sh
kubectl get services

# NAME                                TYPE           CLUSTER-IP       EXTERNAL-IP                                                               PORT(S)        AGE
# juice-balancer                      ClusterIP      10.100.29.23     <none>                                                                    3000/TCP       3m14s
# kubernetes                          ClusterIP      10.100.0.1       <none>                                                                    443/TCP        11h
# multi-juicer-service-loadbalancer   LoadBalancer   10.100.134.210   YOUR_DNS_RECORD_WILL_BE_HERE.eu-north-1.elb.amazonaws.com                 80:32111/TCP   3m13s
```

Use `kubectl get pods`to see the pods you have successfully running, which should be similar to

```sh
kubectl get pods
# NAME                                 READY   STATUS      RESTARTS   AGE
# cleanup-job-ID-ID                    0/1     Completed   0          48m
# juice-balancer-ID-ID                 1/1     Running     0          80m
# progress-watchdog-ID-ID              1/1     Running     0          80m


kubectl get pods -n kube-system
# NAME                                      READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
# alb-ingress-controller-ID-ID              1/1     Running   0          30s
# aws-node-ID                               1/1     Running   0          59m
# aws-node-ID                               1/1     Running   0          59m
# coredns-ID-ID                             1/1     Running   0          65m
# coredns-ID-ID                             1/1     Running   0          65m
# kube-proxy-ID                             1/1     Running   0          59m
# kube-proxy-ID                             1/1     Running   0          59m
```

## Step 5. Deinstallation

```sh
helm delete multi-juicer

# Delete the loadbalancer setup
kubectl delete -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/juice-shop/multi-juicer/main/guides/aws/loadbalancer.yaml

# Delete the kubernetes cluster
eksctl delete cluster multi-juicer
```

In order to nuke the hole account, e.g. resources like the created _security groups_ or _VPCs_, consider to run the destructive [aws-nuke](https://github.com/rebuy-de/aws-nuke).
